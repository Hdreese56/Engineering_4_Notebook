## Dice Roller
### Description
This assignment was to simulate a dice being rolled on our raspberry pi. This assignment utilized a while loop and a random.
### Reflection 
This assignment was a struggle for me because python is by no means my strong suit and I have been coding in java for the past two months so it gonna take some getting used too to get back into the swing. The only difference is the syntax is a little different but the logic is the same. I did need a little help from jude though.
## Calculator
### Description
The objective of this assignment was to create a program that uses functions and allows the user to add, subtract, multipy, divide, and mod.
### Reflection
The main problem I ran into was actually organizing my code and getting us to the syntax of indenting and what not. This was difficult for me because in java you can use brackets to organize your code making it alot cleaner. A solution I had was to put the functions at the top and group them together so it is easier tofind them and less messy.
## Quadratic Solver
### Description
The objective of this assignment was to create a program that would find the real roots of a simple mathmatic quadratic equation while detecting if there were and imaginary roots. The program did this by finding the discriminant.
### Reflection
This assignment wasn't too hard. Mainly cause I kinda got the hang of functions and understand how exactly they work. I definitely could have made my code alot more consice by using one function instead of three but I didn't want to risk meeing the single function up just incase it got too complicated. I used a sperated function for the discriminant just because it allowed me to reject the imaginary roots a little easier. I also have started coding on JDOODLE, a free IDE that we use for my CS class. It allows me to save my work really easily and makes debugging and executing alot quicker as well.
## Strings and loops
### Description
The main goal of this assignment was to create a program that splits up a sentence letter by letter and prints each on a different line, it also uses dashes to show the spaces. 
### Reflection
This assignment allowed me to use my new found function skills and really put them too the test. By doing this I use a single function the Split up the Words first using a split() and then use another split() to split up the words. I also use 2 for loops insinde the function that allowed the function to keep looping. To replace the spaces I drew inspiration from Graham Lenert and used a replace(), this allows you to input the thing you want to replace and the item your replacing it with, like this, b=b.replace("a", "x"), This would replace all A's for x's inside the B. I once again used Jdoodle to write my code then transfered it too beagle term. I would recommend using a separate IDE for these assignment, I just streamlines the process a bit.
## MSP
### Description
Essentially make a hangman program using the various skills we have learned so far.
### Reflection
The main idea of the assignment wasn't very hard and was a great exersize to incorperate our skills we have learned so far. The main trouble I ran into was the printing of the actual hangman. This could have been done alot easier ways than I did it, probably with an array or array list. But I just hard coded it. Definitely wasn't the moves but thats OK. This assignment was also great to use replit on and allowed me to collaborate in real time with classmates. 
## SSH
### Description
The purpose of this assignment was to set up SSH and get a feel for it. The goal was to wire up an LED and make it blink using the program.
### Reflection
Setting up SSH was a pain. I took a while to figure out why my IP was wrong and it was because I typed in hostname -i instead of hostname -I. So that took me the longest time to figure out. Then once I finally tried to connect to SSH I found out that my pi was offline and I couldn't connect to the internet because my wpa supplicant file was broken so I had to delete some file the reboot my pi. Finally I was onto the coding and wiring part. This was fairly simple but I didn't know how to use the battery so I ended up just connecting my pi with the other provided cable. I figured out the gpio pins by just googling guide and the images were very helpful. In all honesty this assignment took me alot longer than it should have.
