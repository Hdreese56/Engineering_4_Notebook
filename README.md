## Dice Roller
### Description
This assignment was to simulate a dice being rolled on our raspberry pi. This assignment utilized a while loop and a random.
### Reflection 
This assignment was a struggle for me because python is by no means my strong suit and I have been coding in java for the past two months so it gonna take some getting used too to get back into the swing. The only difference is the syntax is a little different but the logic is the same. I did need a little help from jude though.
## Calculator
### Description
The objective of this assignment was to create a program that uses functions and allows the user to add, subtract, multipy, divide, and mod.
### Reflection
The main problem I ran into was actually organizing my code and getting us to the syntax of indenting and what not. This was difficult for me because in java you can use brackets to organize your code making it alot cleaner. A solution I had was to put the functions at the top and group them together so it is easier tofind them and less messy.
## Quadratic Solver
### Description
The objective of this assignment was to create a program that would find the real roots of a simple mathmatic quadratic equation while detecting if there were and imaginary roots. The program did this by finding the discriminant.
### Reflection
This assignment wasn't too hard. Mainly cause I kinda got the hang of functions and understand how exactly they work. I definitely could have made my code alot more consice by using one function instead of three but I didn't want to risk meeing the single function up just incase it got too complicated. I used a sperated function for the discriminant just because it allowed me to reject the imaginary roots a little easier. I also have started coding on JDOODLE, a free IDE that we use for my CS class. It allows me to save my work really easily and makes debugging and executing alot quicker as well.
## Strings and loops
### Description
The main goal of this assignment was to create a program that splits up a sentence letter by letter and prints each on a different line, it also uses dashes to show the spaces. 
### Reflection
This assignment allowed me to use my new found function skills and really put them too the test. By doing this I use a single function the Split up the Words first using a split() and then use another split() to split up the words. I also use 2 for loops insinde the function that allowed the function to keep looping. To replace the spaces I drew inspiration from Graham Lenert and used a replace(), this allows you to input the thing you want to replace and the item your replacing it with, like this, b=b.replace("a", "x"), This would replace all A's for x's inside the B. I once again used Jdoodle to write my code then transfered it too beagle term. I would recommend using a separate IDE for these assignment, I just streamlines the process a bit.
