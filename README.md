## Dice Roller
### Description
THis assignment was to simulate a dice being rolled on our raspberry pi. This assignment utilized a while loop and a random.
### Reflection 
This assignment was a struggle for me because python is by no means my strong suit and I have been coding in java for the past two months so it gonna take some getting used too to get back into the swing. The only difference is the syntax is a little different but the logic is the same. I did need a little help from jude though.
