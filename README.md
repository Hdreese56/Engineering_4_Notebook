## Dice Roller
### Description
THis assignment was to simulate a dice being rolled on our raspberry pi. This assignment utilized a while loop and a random.
### Reflection 
This assignment was a struggle for me because python is by no means my strong suit and I have been coding in java for the past two months so it gonna take some getting used too to get back into the swing. The only difference is the syntax is a little different but the logic is the same. I did need a little help from jude though.
## Calculator
### Description
The objective of this assignment was to create a program that uses functions and allows the user to add, subtract, multipy, divide, and mod.
### Reflection
The main problem I ran into was actually organizing my code and getting us to the syntax of indenting and what not. This was difficult for me because in java you can use brackets to organize your code making it alot cleaner. A solution I had was to put the functions at the top and group them together so it is easier tofind them and less messy.
